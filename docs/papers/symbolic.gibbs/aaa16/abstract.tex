Probabilistic inference in many real-world problems often requires
graphical models with (1)~nonlinear deterministic constraints between
random variables (e.g., laws of physics) and (2)~piecewise
distributions (e.g., priors enforcing bounded parameter values).
While Gibbs sampling provides an attractive asymptotically unbiased
MCMC approximation approach that does not require proposal design or
tuning, it cannot be directly applied to models with determinism in
the case of (1) and often requires manual derivation of complex
piecewise conditional distributions in the case of (2).  To address
both limitations, we introduce a rich class of piecewise algebraic
graphical models with nonlinear determinism, where we show that
deterministic constraints can always be eliminated through collapsing.
We further show that the form of the collapsed model always permits
one \emph{symbolic} integral --- sufficient to \emph{automatically}
derive conditionals for Gibbs sampling.  We evaluate this fully
automated Symbolic Gibbs sampler for nonlinear piecewise graphical
models on examples motivated by physics and engineering and show it
converges an order of magnitude faster than existing Monte Carlo
samplers.
